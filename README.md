# DevOps & Infrastructure Examples Repository

Welcome to my DevOps & Infrastructure Examples Repository. Here, I showcase my experience and expertise in DevTools, automation, DevOps, and infrastructure. This repository includes practical implementations of CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), and other infrastructure-related projects.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find real-world examples demonstrating best practices in building, deploying, and managing robust infrastructure. Each project is carefully crafted to highlight specific aspects of automation, DevOps practices, and IaC.

## Table of Contents

- [Branching Strategies](https://github.com/griffin-38/devops-infra-examples/blob/master/release_process/branching_strategies.jpg): Orchestrated a unified branching strategy to consolidate various development efforts, enabling more coherent collaboration across teams. This strategy was critical in reducing merge conflicts, facilitating better change management, and accelerating our time-to-market.
- [Strategic Release Management](https://github.com/griffin-38/devops-infra-examples/tree/master/release_process): Developed a streamlined release process to enhance SDLC and STLC efficiencies. This approach improved our release cadence and deployment quality, ensuring seamless transitions between development stages and production environments.
- [Database Cleanup Script](https://github.com/griffin-38/devOps-infra-examples/tree/master/db_cleanup): Designed to streamline database resets, this script offers an efficient solution for developers and testers to manage database environments. It seamlessly integrates into CI/CD pipelines, enhancing automation and simplifying database management tasks.
- [Web Reports - Jenkins and Docker Repository](https://github.com/griffin-38/devops-infra-examples/blob/master/web_reports_jenkins_docker/README.md): This project focuses on streamlining internal reporting and boosting team efficiency. By integrating Jenkins and Docker into our CI/CD pipeline, we've accelerated automation tasks, ensuring faster and more reliable internal reporting processes.
- [Terraform, Ansible & AWS](https://github.com/griffin-38/devops-infra-examples/tree/master/terra_ansible_aws): In this repository, I provide code examples that demonstrate how Terraform and Ansible can be used to set up an AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. It's a comprehensive guide to orchestrating resource deployment, utilizing modules specifically designed for Amazon EKS, EC2, S3, and Lambda.
- [Architecture & Infrastructure Overview for a Fintech/Lending Platform](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p3QdGpQXC053D6QftkbMTkORFA68yO4H/edit#slide=id.p1): This presentation and demo provide an overview of an infrastructure diagram specifically tailored for a Fintech/Lending Platform. It delves into the key design and architectural concepts, offering insights into efficient infrastructure planning.
- [Infra Diagrams](https://github.com/griffin-38/devops-infra-examples/tree/master/infra_diagrams): These diagrams are essential tools used in demos and presentations to elucidate various infrastructure concepts. They serve as visual aids to simplify complex infrastructure setups and strategies.
